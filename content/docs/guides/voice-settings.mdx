copy-paste reference for ElevenLabs agent voice settings. for full setup instructions, see the [ElevenLabs setup guide](/docs/guides/elevenlabs-setup).

## voice parameters explained

| parameter | range | recommended | what it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **stability** | 0.0–1.0 | 0.5 | controls pitch and speed variation. lower values sound more expressive and human; higher values sound more consistent but robotic |
| **similarity boost** | 0.0–1.0 | 0.75 | how closely the output matches the original voice. higher values are more accurate but can sound less natural |
| **style exaggeration** | 0.0–1.0 | 0.4 | amplifies the voice's speaking style. too high sounds dramatic; too low sounds flat |
| **speaker boost** | on/off | on | enhances clarity and audio presence. generally leave this on |

## quick copy-paste settings

```

### first message (optional)

```
Hey there. I'm here to help you think through conversations — how they flow,
where they shift, that kind of thing. Just talk naturally, and I'll listen
for patterns.
```

## presets for different use cases

| use case | stability | similarity | style | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **casual conversation** | 0.4 | 0.75 | 0.4 | most natural, slight variation |
| **professional analysis** | 0.6 | 0.8 | 0.3 | more consistent, less expressive |
| **maximum naturalness** | 0.35 | 0.7 | 0.45 | most human-like, may vary more |
| **clear narration** | 0.7 | 0.85 | 0.2 | stable and predictable delivery |

## troubleshooting

| problem | fix |
| --- | --- |
| still sounds robotic | lower stability to 0.4 |
| voice cuts out | increase stability to 0.6 |
| too slow | reduce response length |
| too monotone | lower stability, increase style |
| interrupts too much | lower turn detection sensitivity |
| doesn't interrupt enough | raise turn detection sensitivity |
