description: get natural-sounding voice output from the CultureLens agent in minutes
---

this is the fastest path to making the CultureLens voice agent sound natural. for full details, see the [ElevenLabs setup guide](/docs/guides/elevenlabs-setup).

## prerequisites

- an [ElevenLabs account](https://elevenlabs.io) (free tier works)
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and `ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID` configured in `.env`
- the CultureLens app running locally (`npm run dev`)

## the problem

the default ElevenLabs voice with default settings sounds robotic — monotone delivery, no variation in pacing, and scripted-sounding responses.

## the fix

### 1. open agent settings

go to [elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai), find your agent, and click **Edit Agent**.

### 2. select a natural voice

| voice | gender | notes | tier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Rachel** ⭐ | female | warm, conversational — best default choice | free |
| **Drew** | male | approachable, natural pacing | free |
| **Clyde** | male | calm, thoughtful — good for analysis delivery | free |

### 3. set voice parameters

```
stability: 0.5
similarity: 0.75
style: 0.4
speaker boost: ON
```

### 4. set conversation parameters

```
response style: conversational
response length: medium
interruptions: ON
turn detection sensitivity: medium
```

### 5. save and test

save the agent, open the CultureLens app, connect to the agent, and test. you should hear natural conversational speech with varied pacing and tone.

## how voice selection works in the app

the app provides 4 pre-configured voices in the UI. when a user selects a voice, it overrides the agent's default via the ElevenLabs SDK:

```typescript
await conversation.startSession({
  agentId: AGENT_ID,
  overrides: {
    tts: {
      voiceId: selectedVoice,
      stability: 0.5,
      similarity_boost: 0.75,
      style: 0.4,
      use_speaker_boost: true,
    },
  },
});
```

this means in-app voice selection takes priority over dashboard settings.

## before vs. after

| aspect | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tone | monotone, robotic | natural conversational tone |
| pacing | no variation | varied pacing and emphasis |
| feel | reading from a script | talking to a real person |

## still sounds robotic?

1. make sure you saved the agent — changes don't apply until you click Save
2. disconnect and reconnect — old settings may be cached
3. try Rachel or Drew — they're the most natural-sounding free voices
4. lower stability to 0.4 for even more variation

## pro tip

for the most natural output, combine Rachel voice (stability 0.4–0.5, style 0.3–0.4) with the full system prompt from `AGENT_PROMPT.md` which adds natural filler words and conversational pacing.
