description: developer documentation for CultureLens — consent-based conversation analytics with cultural awareness
---

welcome to the CultureLens developer documentation. CultureLens is a consent-based conversation mirror that analyzes communication patterns with cultural awareness, delivering neutral audio insights without judgment.

built during [MLH HackHive 2026](https://mlh.io), it combines real-time voice AI with sophisticated analysis pipelines to provide non-judgmental feedback on conversational dynamics.

## what CultureLens does

- **real-time voice interaction** — ElevenLabs conversational AI agent with 4 natural voices, WebSocket streaming, and in-app voice selection
- **cultural communication analysis** — Google Gemini 2.5 Flash analyzes directness, formality, power dynamics, turn-taking, and interruption patterns
- **privacy-first architecture** — dual consent requirement, ephemeral and transcript-only storage modes, GDPR-compliant data export and account deletion
- **edge-optimized pipeline** — Vercel Edge Functions + Firebase Admin SDK for sub-100ms auth verification across 23 API endpoints
